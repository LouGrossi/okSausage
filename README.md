Sau'Sage Quest
Ascension of the Wiener Wizard

This originally started as a project to mess around with TypeScript. The initial thought
was to create a website that was completely unnavigable. Essentially you'd have to find the
links through a series of events. There was not going to be any documentation on how to do that.

This morphed into a game, and now it's going to be Sau'Sage Quest.

In the spirit of keeping the out of control nature I decided that I'd let anyone push code to it,
and upon approval it will be merged into master and deployed out to the site.

It's really just starting out, so I don't know what will happen - but it is a fun way to learn, so
I'll keep it going until I get too busy or too bored.

Thanks for looking...
